								learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
								former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about
								the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
								They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
								assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
								outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
								no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
								during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
								certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
								receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
